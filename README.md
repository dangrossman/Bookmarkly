This repository contains the code behind [Bookmarkly](http://bookmarkly.com), a bookmark organizer built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) in the browser and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on the server with data persisted to MySQL.

Some features:

* Add bookmarks with a bookmarklet, Chrome extension or through the site
* Saves URL, title, description, tags with autosuggest and a screenshot
* Bookmark grid view resizes with the window and loads more bookmarks on scroll
* Can import bookmark files exported from IE, Chrome, Firefox and Delicious
* No page reloads at all, so moving between pages is near-instant and smooth
* Combines and minifies all the JS source and view templates automatically when the server starts

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org/)

3. Install dependencies: `npm install -d`

4. Create a MySQL database with the 3 tables in `schema.sql`

5. Edit the configuration section of `server.js` to point to your database

6. Run `node server.js` and browse to `http://localhost:3000`

If you get an error from express on launch, you may need to `npm install connect@0.5.10`

## TODO

The screenshot generating server is currently a separate repository that I have not yet released.
